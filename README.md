### **Project Overview**:
  The "Analysis of Customer Retention" project is aimed at understanding and improving customer retention rates for a business. 
  As customer retention is a critical factor in sustaining growth and profitability, this project focuses on leveraging data-driven insights 
  to identify trends, patterns, and potential drivers of customer churn. The analysis will be conducted in collaboration with cross-functional teams, 
  including data engineers, product managers and account managers, and will utilize tools like SQL, Databricks, and Tableau as visualization tool.

### **1. Data Gathering and Preparation:** 
  * Define project scope, objectives, and deliverables
  * Identify stakeholders: Data Engineers, Product Managers, Account Manager
  * Set up communication channels (meetings, emails, collaboration tools)
  * Collaborate with Data Engineers to gather relevant customer data using SQL
  * Clean, transform, and structure the data
  * Verify data quality and consistency

### **2. Cohort Analysis:**
 Utilize Databricks to perform cohort analysis, grouping customers based on common characteristics or time periods. Calculate retention rates for each cohort 
 to identify trends over time.

 ### **3. Visualization and Dashboard Creation:**
 Create interactive visualizations and dashboards in Tableau to present retention metrics, cohort performance, and potential churn factors. The visualizations 
 will make complex data insights more accessible to stakeholders

 ### **4. Insight Generation:**
 Analyze the visualized data to extract meaningful insights about customer retention trends, including identifying periods of high churn and potential influencing 
 factors.
